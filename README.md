# PacMen Exercise

This creates a factory of Pacmen. It utilizes the position and velocity at each moment to move.

**HOW TO USE?**

When 'Add Pacman' is clicked, any number of pacmen can be added.
With 'Start Game', the pacmen begin moving and bounce off the walls and change direction. 
Download all files and drop the html file on your browser to see it in action!


Improvements for the future: I plan to make the pacmen move around chomping. So they would be continuously closing and opening their mouths while they move and bounce on the walls and do the same in the opposite direction.
